# non-hair-FFHQ
Non-hair-FFHQ dataset  is a high-quality image dataset that contains 6,000 non-hair FFHQ portraits, based on [ stylegan2-ada](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch) and [ffhq-dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset).

The dataset is built by our HairMapper method.

We apply our method on FFHQ images (All images have licenses that allow **free use, redistribution, and adaptation for non-commercial purposes**) and present a [non-hair-FFHQ](https://github.com/oneThousand1000/non-hair-FFHQ) dataset that contains 6,000 non-hair portraits to inspire and facilitate more works in the future.

## Overview

Google drive link of the dataset will be released soon.
